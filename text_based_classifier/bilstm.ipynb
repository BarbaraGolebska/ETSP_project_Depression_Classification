         "yeah there's also on Craigslist so that's why okay how are you doing today I'm doing good thank you I'm from Los Angeles I'm great I live in West Los Angeles the west side it's all right I live alone so I love it I'm from here so I grew up here it's natural the weather on the weather it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment traffic the traffic is horrible I'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance I study business I didn't no I've been done for a few years so I haven't gone to school for a while one of these days I'll go back to graduate school but my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money I don't know I don't really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment I don't know I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but I don't know I think when the situation is right I don't think it's too difficult yep I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so I'm pretty close there around so I really mad stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all what's a good example this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so I don't remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back what do you mean okay at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym listen to music a lot of Musician's Friend so I just I'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative who's been deposit they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so I don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time I guess it depends on who you talk to I'm okay at it I can probably work at that I don't know I mean I can I think I can do better go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don't know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better now now no nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know but then again I think that's natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don't like law and I don't like Madison so so it wasn't meant to be so yeah I think I think my in my life I knew that there's a lot of things I have there's more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of I'm kind of answered itself so no it's I don't think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you memorable experiences I think it's just I don't really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative I think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like I gotten somewhere maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire yeah I want the last time I really felt happy I don't know I'm not really someone who is like I don't have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven't hit any Lowe's so I mean I don't know I'm usually pretty I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I'm able to accomplish something then then hey I'm happy no I don't really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends I think they would say that I'm very outgoing I'm pretty determined I'm trying now I tried I try to interact as much as possible I'm always out networking as much as possible so I don't know I guess that's basically what I think they would describe me is okay no problem I was weird

         "wow okay when you're finished when she's done okay thank you how are you doing today okay how about yourself here in California all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of I'm job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here traffic Maybe the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis sociology I have a 2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology no I'm actually MTA bus operator what's your well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature thanks well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible what do you mean I'm sorry okay free take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes okay I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated I'm pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I'm still learning today I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know I love them in my family thank you no set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home well by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old yeah I'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time yeah thank you the hardest thing is we're right now I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can with my kids or Just. what's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I'm the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that's the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me thank you happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I'm schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it's never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why I'm starting my class next week thank you well device I would have gave myself then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that I probably wouldn't stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career I'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones I feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I'm going to school late but still I'm going you know I want to better myself career-wise so yes my oldest daughter we had an argument because the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though is true or or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but lettuce happened you know I just told her my I'm sorry very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life and I've been she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that I'm doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like I didn't told you I left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change how hot is it it's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and I'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but the ball is in her Court you know only can do so much oh wow Oh my days since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it's important have a good night's rest because it kind of like it it kind of like I guess you're ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody have their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested and it helped me what am I like irritated tired lazy you know feel like I want to lay down probably go to sleep never thought about that you know cuz like I said you know everybody had a moment to do I thought about that no no okay how your best friend describe you I don't really have a best friend but person that I deal with it I used to work with she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing a go-getter Dependable responsible I'm a people person I get along with others you know I'm kind of like I live in a good Mark whether I know you are not if you was to you know like like you and I now you know I I I you probably sell she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that thank you well I try to stay happy I rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what I mean especially when I go to pick him up from school or just up to me thank you
