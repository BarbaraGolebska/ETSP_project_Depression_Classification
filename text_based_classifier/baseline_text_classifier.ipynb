         "wow okay when you're finished when she's done okay thank you how are you doing today okay how about yourself here in California all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of I'm job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here traffic Maybe the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis sociology I have a 2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology no I'm actually MTA bus operator what's your well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature thanks well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible what do you mean I'm sorry okay free take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes okay I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated I'm pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I'm still learning today I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know I love them in my family thank you no set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home well by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old yeah I'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time yeah thank you the hardest thing is we're right now I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can with my kids or Just. what's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I'm the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that's the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me thank you happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I'm schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it's never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why I'm starting my class next week thank you well device I would have gave myself then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that I probably wouldn't stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career I'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones I feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I'm going to school late but still I'm going you know I want to better myself career-wise so yes my oldest daughter we had an argument because the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though is true or or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but lettuce happened you know I just told her my I'm sorry very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life and I've been she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that I'm doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like I didn't told you I left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change how hot is it it's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and I'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but the ball is in her Court you know only can do so much oh wow Oh my days since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it's important have a good night's rest because it kind of like it it kind of like I guess you're ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody have their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested and it helped me what am I like irritated tired lazy you know feel like I want to lay down probably go to sleep never thought about that you know cuz like I said you know everybody had a moment to do I thought about that no no okay how your best friend describe you I don't really have a best friend but person that I deal with it I used to work with she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing a go-getter Dependable responsible I'm a people person I get along with others you know I'm kind of like I live in a good Mark whether I know you are not if you was to you know like like you and I now you know I I I you probably sell she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that thank you well I try to stay happy I rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what I mean especially when I go to pick him up from school or just up to me thank you

I'm just close my mom my knees some of my nephews and that's about it okay can you have done anything to avoid it have I done anything to avoid it to avoid them yeah I just don't talk to my don't call my phone ask about on my you know I talked to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but I just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up I just know that's on them and I really don't want to do it himself how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last going on a year you know I I I depends on my thought process at time I liked it I've been looking for work quite a bit so I was just wondering why you know I don't get called I I just have I have racing thoughts so or I get depressed you know cuz I are worried about things that you know that really I have no control over so you know lately I just been sleeping too much for me because I was so used to just sleeping 4 to 5 hours a night too and now it's changed about 8 to 9 hours and I'm still tired do you feel that way often lately I have them for about the last few months what are you like when you don't sleep well tired you know I don't sleep well you know that I just do all back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know I'm more of a guy and I love the work and if I'm not then I just looked too much time for me to spend in my own head and so either I'll even if I'm busy I'm doing what I need to do know and whatever job I do like, you know get into it I enjoy it something new for me and so I can think about you know either work or I can go home and then think about this you know I don't have to worry about no money your bill is getting paid and I can just concentrate on other things either you know doing the things I like or maybe spending a little more time with my girlfriend or you know so how do you cook with them how do I cover them I just try not to think about it as it's not about what are coping with it or not I just do is I'm a horrible guy that just you know I may take me a moment to to all Salem cooking something but you know how it is if I have no control over it there's nothing that I can really do about it. One thing I can do is continue to do what I'm doing and that's actively looking for work. Going out on interviews talking with others about work so I can just come out and I'll get back to back to basics you know I just don't like the loss of balme does bother me but I try not to to let it continue bother me yes that got me a if what has got me in trouble my mood choice I mean yeah money I mean my past I got a past history so which kind of tends to ibobber my my hiring process I don't know them when I get hired so I got to do it a different different type of employers who are felony friendly and stuff like that and I tried you know I was out taking classes on now oh not how to interview how to how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and I got to reflect back on that but I just I got to keep putting in my head if that's not who who I want to be anymore so or you know I've done I've done now I've done my time so to say but I took the time you know the last time I just took a lot of time in and try to work on the issues that were bothering me LOL positive stuff I got my GED two different things to a lot of classes thought about going to school and going to school and anything that would cause I change my old ways and and and try to move on to more productive activities that's good are you still in here that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time have you been diagnosed with depression been diagnosed with bipolar how hard is that stopping me don't you know I don't medicate so I mean I have been on medication before in the past but I guess I try to live on while I try to live life on life's terms and I just you know I know the medical establishment always want to label something in and what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills and I've been on probably every magical feel that there is for that and you know how long I've been too strong or something that's coming up and so I just try to cope with things which is my life skills you know I I don't I don't want to be using probably I know certain drugs work for like 3 to 4 months 6 months and they go load it while I'm going to try on this phone or I'm going to try on that and it's just an ongoing process tonight probably for about the last two years ask about three years I can kind of just said you know what that's it and I what are the difference in whether or if I would be on meds for it I don't think so you know it's just still the same stuff I still get the same problem can I still get the same anxiety that's if I if I was on medication for it or not so I just and I'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good and I get irritated at people a lot I don't like people I don't like crowds I don't like I'm not just people and empty quiet so but I got a pretty nice not that I personality but I think people can see me and just say I don't mess with this guy or you know but she'll you know I like I all right public transportation quite a bit and now you just get a lot of loud I'm not just people on there sometimes I got to get off the bus that's how I deal with people because I just know there's consequences if I didn't deal with it that way. Go I'd rather take the time on get off the bus wait for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad I understand did you think you have a phone before you come back did I have problem before I get out well I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out the thing is that I know other people I have a lot of the same town so I know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when I told him that I was diagnosed with bipolar that a lot of remorse for like all that's what you know that's what was wrong with you know we wish you that you would have found that out years ago and like I said I don't think the meds really work but what I do I think time, I just getting older kind of makes it work median with lights how do you say therapist affected you how do I talk to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while recently and I don't want to get out my anger my thoughts a lot of people other people may not understand a therapist is I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out whatever is problem it would be people in Ohio other issues you don't work or whatever the case maybe is that I just think talking about it and they're such good listener thinking, like now that they give me the same advice I give myself or whatever that I would give to others but it's always helpful to hear from somebody else somebody who suppose we have to go to school for I don't go anymore so I kind of miss it you know like I said I just one of those things you know I just deal with it you know according to let you know if I ever get a chance to go to therapy again. Charlottsville all monetary reasons and and all I don't have health insurance and there's a lot of things that you know I like to do but I can't the money situation is not that great right now so I'm sorry how does my friends describe me they would probably describe me as a energetic outgoing person once I get to know people laugh I know Apple I laugh a lot but it would probably tell you that I'm also very serious and and hidden person I don't reveal a lot positive influence in your life Domino's menu I'll probably my boss one of my bosses when I first trailer with a what exotic animals he was real and he was German and Bennigan's he don't know what he saw in me but he talked a lot about working with exotic animals and show a lot of confidence in man with your engine and also build confidence in myself and sort of let me know that you know this is nothing that I really can accomplish if I put my mind to it okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me goodbye she said good-bye and then we just have a quick postcode for you",

         "looking at you all right okay so now let's make sure the Xbox Kinect is picking you up with his move around dance can't wait till this guy pops up is like a little green skeleton okay when is the temperature let you know and you can just hit the door. So let me know. thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend I don't judge I can I'm a computer I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you I'll ask a few questions to get it started and please feel your answers where are you from originally Moscow vitamins for life my family move to the US and then I moved down here eventually for college how easy was it for you to get used to long time to leave the money here for about a year since I graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though that's good how do you like your living situation. I have two roommates and there's a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year in a couple months I think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality TV show for a while how do you know the ones from college and the other one I found on Craigslist how close are you to that varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so I just pretty cuz right now I kind of distant tell me more about that event the distance okay, well we haven't seen each other around hung out in like 2 weeks cuz one of them got into like with car accident and so she's been distant since 10 and kind of locks herself up in her room and the other one is always working late so we are scheduling has been off and the ones we made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone I guess to make the first move yeah that sucks it's okay how are you at controlling your temper it depends with whom I'm dealing with I guess I would say it was them people I guess is my family's not very good my boyfriend is not very good but with other people that I might not know so well then I'm able to control little bit more but I'll do a little more passive aggressive rather than my full on anger Sonic songs Houston has been a positive influence in your life she's probably been she's been we've been best friends for High School freshman year of high school when we first mom give me an example of that as of what how do you know that my friend to call we met in French class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kind of surgeon homework together and we had a lot of cloud the same classes together and so you can send Hangouts and then we just became closer and stay really close since then what are some things you like to do for fun at going out with friends and the bar is going dancing biking hiking staying active then the movies playing at Cedar Restaurant stop tography was hanging out with friends I guess whatever okay how close are you to your family and various like I'm really close to them when it comes to things of a like schoolwork those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things I don't really discuss that with them Vegas superficially Club but I rely on them a lot so what by guess what are some things that make you really mad I guess it depends who it is again I guess people who are in considerate and thoughtful flaky ignorant and yeah and get those kinds of people and then people just and it's a lot of things that people react to different situations can make me angry I guess when was the last time you argue with someone and what was it about my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money and so so finding that when he doesn't see the orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not very healthy and so I got frustrated with him cuz I'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and that each time he was going to do it when you do it then he doesn't phase consulate breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry people who don't follow through yeah do you feel that way often about other people about myself or angry whatever comes to your mind angry I am so glad that now I don't feel angry often okay what's your dream job that is a tough one how about getting paid to leave me now that's kind of what I'm going to figure out right now cuz I quit my full-time job because I hated it as opposed to sitting in an office all day which I thought was extremely boring so now I work in a restaurant job and I'm too old for a second job to support myself my dream job I don't know what it would be but I know it involves people and I'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment turns band and yet there's something I realized I like to see the result from all my hard work cuz I majored in sociology and as much as I love that major it's you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing in arguing but with no real solution such as like as a and that's all you have is just being theoretical element that you can't do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or no people amazing artistic I love photography I love cooking baking and particularly so I know something and that Mom I guess okay you travel a lot I used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to 578 different countries I've lived in three or four different countries I haven't traveled a lot lately just because I have no money and jobs kind of tie you down but I would love to have that is my dream job would be a photographer for National Geographic that would be awesome or a food photographer that traveled but anyways you enjoy about traveling in the new places near faces and experiences I get Restless very easily it says nice of conflict be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine I hate the routine and Monday mass of everyday life is so it's nice to does things. I want to hear about one of your trips okay tennis tank mermaid trips I have begun talking about I don't know what's funny even though I've been to lots of different country is one of my most memorable memorable trips as one of the trips I took with my family is a three-week road trip with my family this five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon but it was really fun and even though I've traveled so many places I realize that there's like such a beauty and the American landscape and so we were all around this house last in the Grand Canyon to Zion to the Grand Tetons to Yellowstone and it's absolutely amazing to sing about natural beauty is so and it's a grizzly bear black bear the Bison sounds really cool natural wonders also really miss me cuz those things aren't men made as as pretentious as it sounds after while you're kind of gets old but it's like and I guess the same way white old white man building great buildings in artwork and yeah I see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I want pretty easy as long as I get supply I sleep so easy what are you like when you don't sleep well grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much I just kind of offer in my own world you feel that way often anymore I usually get enough sleep and I've been working out more so it's not too bad that's good have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately I haven't just been one negative but I have to do it by circumstances kind of like spend about almost 5 months since I quit my full-time job haven't found anything else boyfriend interested in so Esmeralda's like what am I doing that I did that kind of thing can be talked about a good job these days it is higher than market and looks like I'm very picky because I don't want to just sit in a little my own Cuba fault if I quit my job exactly for that reason why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that I quit my other job so it looks like I have to make it worthwhile that I quit my last job to get a better job as a kind of like stuck in this section of like living paycheck-to-paycheck barely making it just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when did I give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world and spitting and we'll keep a cold I don't know when does that same situation after college so but I guess it's tough cuz a lot of my friends so they went to a pretty good school and you not have a friend his teaching English in Afghanistan Teach for America and their friends in Hartford at schools like Harvard Matthew not getting her master's that's kind of like got that comparison and then here I am with you in a little restaurant job so do you feel down I do sometimes yes but I'm going to Hawaii next week so right now I'm fine yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because I'm just trying to find like what I'm supposed to do you not like what I want to do next and my money situations are just very stressful as a school loan to pay off Insurance rent car loans like ants the groceries but I can't even afford groceries it's just hard to live this way specially after we paid so much money for amazing cause education so frustrating but there's a lot of people the same situation have you been diagnosed with depression I don't think so but I mean I think everyone goes through depression here now so I don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose I'm not on meds okay have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD okay what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago oh that's to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail cuz I'm one of those people from not going to be the best at something and I'm not going to try except the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but I didn't get them told my high school self that don't try lots of things even if it means I'm not going to be the best at it about 10 years ago made me like 12 so I used to do a lot of things but I used to ask and it got to continue doing that I used to write a lot when I was younger I used to write miniature like little sorry sorry sorry it's for my parents all the time and I kind of stopped doing those things cuz it's like I'm not good at it so I'm not going to do it I just continue doing those things and tried sneaking out of classes and I'm no different sports soccer growing up I don't know just expand my sophomore rather than likely I'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder cuz like I said I was going to say that one that was like once I'm good I just stay for good and I'll try that go about that that monster Newsom yeah what do you do to relax all right now it's super lame but I watch TV but I used to read of mice to read on my off-time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake bananas like since I'm on my feet all day and like consol interacting with people I just kind of want to unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and be like I'm done which one of your most memorable experience the top question I'm probably the day I got accepted into Pomona College it was a freshman at Wellesley College courses that woman called back and I hated it from Mike II from like the first week I just knew that I chose the wrong College not like miserable for the entire year and I only apply to one school of the transfer Pomona College by steps at in Clermont and anime how can I get in and I also because there's like a 4% acceptance rate and if I go to the chances like this is ridiculous I don't think we can get in and I'll let you know the thought of going back to sleep but then I got an email from one of the admissions counselors that I had met when I was visiting Pomona and he's like I talk to you I just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about Pomona hope all is well and I was like why are you telling me the day we find out if we got you next that's it or not unless I got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later I got the email that I was accepted into Pomona and I was like my best day of my life so happy cuz I want ya and I text my mom and my little brother hair pierce my dad's I was like let's start this whole thing over how do your best friend describe you The Voice fine maybe Moody you never know what you're going to get sometimes probably definitely friendly like a positive person but sometimes maybe a little bit aggressive the most practicing positive things I mean she's my best friend so okay when is the last time you felt really happy really happy oh and I was in Mexico over winter in San Clemente and that was really fun and it just like when sailing and walked on the missions at the beach that was really fun don't forget time to greet the situation at school okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me goodbye I didn't know you were super good thing set the recording down in a we just have a quick food survey and then I can tell you a little bit more about what",

         "yeah there's also on Craigslist so that's why okay how are you doing today I'm doing good thank you I'm from Los Angeles I'm great I live in West Los Angeles the west side it's all right I live alone so I love it I'm from here so I grew up here it's natural the weather on the weather it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment traffic the traffic is horrible I'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance I study business I didn't no I've been done for a few years so I haven't gone to school for a while one of these days I'll go back to graduate school but my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money I don't know I don't really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment I don't know I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but I don't know I think when the situation is right I don't think it's too difficult yep I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so I'm pretty close there around so I really mad stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all what's a good example this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so I don't remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back what do you mean okay at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym listen to music a lot of Musician's Friend so I just I'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative who's been deposit they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so I don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time I guess it depends on who you talk to I'm okay at it I can probably work at that I don't know I mean I can I think I can do better go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don't know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better now now no nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know but then again I think that's natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don't like law and I don't like Madison so so it wasn't meant to be so yeah I think I think my in my life I knew that there's a lot of things I have there's more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of I'm kind of answered itself so no it's I don't think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you memorable experiences I think it's just I don't really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative I think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like I gotten somewhere maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire yeah I want the last time I really felt happy I don't know I'm not really someone who is like I don't have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven't hit any Lowe's so I mean I don't know I'm usually pretty I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I'm able to accomplish something then then hey I'm happy no I don't really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends I think they would say that I'm very outgoing I'm pretty determined I'm trying now I tried I try to interact as much as possible I'm always out networking as much as possible so I don't know I guess that's basically what I think they would describe me is okay no problem I was weird
